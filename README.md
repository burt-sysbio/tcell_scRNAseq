# Single-cell RNAseq data analysis of T cell transcriptomes
## Description
I here compare mouse and human T cell transcriptomes using published single-cell RNAseq data in the context of different diseases.
The main question I want to adress is whether T cells are more or less heterogeneous in different conditions.
For example, it has been discussed previously that differentiated effector cells have less variance in their transcriptomes than precursor and effector cells
